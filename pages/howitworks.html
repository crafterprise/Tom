                                You'll be assigned a personal portfolio manager if accepted as a client. You can contact your portfolio manager via phone, WhatsApp, and email. 
                                The portfolio manager will handle all the investments in your account managed by Noble Asset Management and offer guidance on all your other financial interests. You'll be able to ask questions about your portfolio, market conditions, long-term financial planning, and anything else concerning finance.
                                 The portfolio manager will not reveal secrets regarding investment strategies but will ensure you have a broad understanding of what you own and why you own it. </div> </div>
